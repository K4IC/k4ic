> <em> A man living on the edge of time itself. See me speedrunning and clashing through different wars at the last minute. Having pressure always lurking by my side through battles and whose punctuality is rarely found I enter the battleground. Conquering deadlines, delivering satisfaction and withstanding sleep I fight until the last second. </em>

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

*> The overriding design goal for Markdown's*
<em> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.*
