# Kristian Allanâ€”@K4IC

> <em> A man living on the edge of time itself. See me speedrunning and clashing through different wars at the last minute. Having pressure always lurking by my side through battles and whose punctuality is rarely found I enter the battleground. Conquering deadlines, delivering satisfaction and withstanding sleep I fight until the last second. </em>
